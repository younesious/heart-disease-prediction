## Description

The script `heart_disease_prediction.py` loads the heart disease dataset, preprocesses it, trains a neural network model, and evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix. Here's a brief overview of the process:

- The dataset is loaded from the 'input' directory using Pandas.
- The features are standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
- A neural network model is created using Keras Sequential API.
- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, and the accuracy is calculated.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset, which contains various attributes related to heart health, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc. The target variable indicates whether a patient has heart disease or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn

Well, like everyone who wants to enter data, they have a heart-disease-prediction using ANN. which is here in Python file format, but I presented it it in Jupyter format!
