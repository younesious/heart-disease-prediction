3. Run the `heart_disease_prediction.py` script to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Usage
- `heart_disease_prediction.py`: Python script containing code to train a neural network model on the heart disease dataset and evaluate its performance using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
- `input/heart.csv`: Dataset file containing the heart disease data.

## Instructions
1. Ensure the dataset (`heart.csv`) is placed inside the `input` directory.
2. Run the `heart_disease_prediction.py` script.
3. The trained model will be evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test dataset.

Well, like everyone who wants to enter data, they have a heart-disease-prediction. which is here in Python file format, but I presented it it in Jupyter format!
